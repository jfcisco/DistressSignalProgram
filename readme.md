# Distress Signal Program

The distress signal program for two devices using either eGizmo or Lilygo setup.

To use this program, upload the Arduino program in the DeviceA/ folder to one device and the Arduino program in DeviceB to a second device.

You can upload by opening the `.ino` file inside each folder in Arduino IDE, and then uploading to each ESP32 device.
